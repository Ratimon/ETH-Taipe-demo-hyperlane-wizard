## Installation

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

#what-is-it-for

This dev tool can be thought as a code generator/ interactive playground to support bridge development using Hyperlane's CLI and its smart contact and . Now it offers  two routes including `collateralized ERC20 & ERC4626 to synthetic`  and `XERC20` routes. Specialised features can also be selected. They are Fast Fee, Fast Transfer and Route Limits Management.
